description: |
  This is an app I created for a school project. We worked in groups of 3 on an Arduino system that catches the mosquito. When a mosquito is caught, it displays on the app the number of mosquitos caught. We can also turn on and off a fan and some LEDs to attract the mosquito in a box that we printed in 3D.
