  This is a portfolio website that I've made for a friend. He made the models and I created the website. I used TypeScript for the first time in a personal project. My goal is to upgrade this website to make it work with Strapi, a headless CMS, to make it easier to manage the content.
support:
  - Next
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind
